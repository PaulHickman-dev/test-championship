    <h3>The effect of penalities</h3>
    <p>Penalty overs changed the finalists <b>{{results.penaltiesEffective/results.count | percent: '1.4'}}</b> of the time.</p>
    <p>The above figure includes occasions where penalty overs changed whether teams were tied for 2nd place after points and series wins.</p>
    <p>NOTE: In the real world where some teams are better at cricket than others, this percentage won't be so high.</p>

    <h3>Tie Breakers</h3>
    <p>Below are the percentage of simulated championships where there was a tie for qualification after points and the number of series were taken into account, and in the real world, the runs-per-wicket rate would be needed to decide who qualifies for the final.<p>

    <p>When using over rate penalties: <b>{{results.penalisedTies/results.count | percent: '1.4'}}</b></p>
    <p>When ignoring over rate penalties: <b>{{results.unpenalisedTies/results.count | percent: '1.4'}}</b></p>

    <h3>Match and series results</h3>
    <p>The table below shows how far the simulated results drifted from your configured probabilities due to the randomness of the simulation. If you re-run this simulation with the same settings, teams should move entirely randomly in this table,

    <h2>Explanations</h2>

    <p class="question">I ran this twice and got different results</p>
    <p class="answer">The winners of each match are picked at random. Over a lot of repetitions, 
        these numbers should tend towards a figure governed by the number of matches played, and the probabilities of each result, but they won't match perfectly. Also, computers aren't perfect at picking random
        numbers so there will be some deviation, but it shouldn't be biased towards any particular team. The more repetitions you choose to simulate,
        the more accurate the results, but the longer it takes.
    </p>

    <p class="question">Why do the teams who play fewer matches qualify more often?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Short Answer:</b>With the ICC scoring system, teams who play fewer matches are mathematically more likely to finish near the top or the bottom of the table. Teams who play
        a lot of matches are more likely to finish in the middle, so are less likely to qualify in the top 2 places.</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Long Answer:</b>120 points are divided between all the matches in a series, so a 5 match series has 24 points on offer per match, whereas a 2 match series has 60 points per match. 
        Let's simplify things a bit by pretending every match has a winner and a loser; draws & ties don't happen, and there is no home advantage:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider the first two series in the schedule - Sri Lanka play a 2 match series against New Zealand which has four possible outcomes. In two of those,
            the same team wins both matches so there is a 50% chance that either Sri Lanka or New Zealand will have a maximum 120 points and a 50% change they
            will have 60 points each.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile England play a 5 match series against Australia. Only 2 of the 32 possible outcomes have the same team win all matches so the probability of
            either England or Australia having maximum points is 12.5%.</li>
        <li>Therefore, it is most likely that Sri Lanka and New Zealand are top than England or Australia being top.</li>        
        <li>As there are only rewards (qualification) for finishing in the top 2 and no penalty for finishing in the bottom 2, England and Australia have been 
            disadvantaged by playing a longer series.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="answer">Adding ties and draws back in to the calculations changes the percentages to be a bit closer than this extreme example, as does playing more series, 
        but the principle remains: teams that play mostly short series are more likely to be at either end of the points table. 
        Teams that play mostly long series are more likely to be in the middle and not qualify for the final.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">If you run this simulator with its default settings that don't bias home/away teams, the bias from short series shows up fairly consistently. 
        With the 2019-21 schedule it would result in England (22 matches) having an approximately 5.5%-6% less chance making the final 
        than Sri Lanka or Pakistan (13 matches each) if they all had an equal chance of winning each match they play.</p>
   
    <p class="question">Why does the penalty overs policy make this bias even more extreme?</p>
    <p class="answer">The more matches a team plays, the more opportunities they have to incur penalty overs, but the probability of a team bowling slowly in a
         given innings doesn't go down, just because the series is longer. As all penalty overs are charged 2 points in all matches,
        the more matches a team plays the more points it is likely to lose. This is an obviously unfair policy.</p>
    <p class="answer">To make this fairer, the points per penalty over in a match should be a percentage of the points given for winning that match, 
        not fixed at 2 in all matches. E.g. 5% of the match points would mean a 2 point penalty in 2 match series, and a 1.2 point penalty in a 5 match series.</p>

    <p class="question">Could it be fixed?</p>
    <p class="answer">There are whole universities full of mathematicians that could give you a better answer than me, but I don't think so - 
        not while teams play series of different lengths and you give points for every match.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You could give more points to longer series; the trouble is the number of extra points you need to give varies
            with the exact mix of series lengths the teams play in a season. The probability of draws that you are assume is going
            to occur also changes the number of extra points you need to give to even things out.</li>
        <li>Therefore, a revised number of points per series would have to be announced each season after the schedule was determined.</li>
        <li>You would also need to make the points lost for each penalty over in a match a fixed percentage of the points for winning that match</li>
        <li>Also, whilst this would actually make thing fairer, it <i>looks</i> more biased than the current system and is far harder to explain.</li>
    </ul>        
    
    <p class="question">How are ties for the top 2 places broken?</p>
    <p class="answer">If teams are tied on points, ties are broken using the number of series won by each team. I don't believe it makes any difference
        if the series not won are drawn or lost.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">In the real Test Championship, if the points and series won are both tied, qualification comes down to runs scored per wicket.
            However, in this simulation, all teams are equally good at cricket; therefore, they would have the same number of runs and the same number of wickets. 
            This simulation randomly chooses from the tied teams, so should not be biased as each tied team stands an equal chance of being picked.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What effect does the frequency of drawn/tied matches have?</p>
    <p class="answer">More frequent draws/ties slightly reduces the amount of bias towards teams that play mostly shorter series, as it reduces their chances of maximum points 
        from a series more than it reduces the chances of maximum points for longer series.</p>
    <p class="answer">However, as it reduces the spread between the highest/lowest point scorers, more draws also increases the chances that penalty overs will play a role in
        determining the finalists.</p>

    <p class="question">What effect does the frequency of drawn series have?</p>
    <p class="answer">Not a lot; more draws means a team is less likely to qualify if tied on points, but the biases to the number of points scored from the series length and penalty overs
        make the effect of this negligible.</p>
    <p class="answer">With a 14.5% chance of a match being drawn, there is a 37% change of a 2-match series being drawn, a 15% for 3-match, 23% for 4-match and
         a 15% chance for a 3-match series being drawn. Unsurprisingly series with odd numbers of matches are drawn less frequently; therefore, teams that play mostly odd
         numbers of series stand a better chance of having a high number of series wins than those that play mostly even numbers, as there will be fewer drawn series.
         Therefore, odd series give a slight advantage in the tie-break, but not enough to overcome he advantage that playing fewer matches has.</p>
    
    <p class="question">How do I know this is accurate? The simulation may contain bugs.</p>
    <p class="answer">This simulation is open source and runs entirely in your browser - there is no server-side code. If you want to review the calculations,
